title: My first post on Jekyll on Github
---

I came across this [article] (http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and the concept about minimalist blog hit me.
It's so true when I saw other blogs that I always like clean designed blog.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
