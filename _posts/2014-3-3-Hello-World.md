title: My first post on Jekyll on Github

I came across this [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) and the concept about minimalist blog hit me. It's so true when I saw other blogs that I always like clean designed blog. Then I did try to blog with [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and it took me only 1 hour to setup everything ready to be blogged using a repository from Barry Clark. You will need [GitHub](www.github.com) account as a prerequisite.
